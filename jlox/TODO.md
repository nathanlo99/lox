CHALLENGES TODO:
- Functions:
  - Function overriding: allow multiple functions with the same name but different arity to exist
- Control flow:
  - Anonymous functions
- Classes:
  - Setters
    - Determine the most convenient syntax for this

CHALLENGES DONE:
- Scanning:
  - Nested C-style block comments
- Parsing:
  - Comma expression
  - Ternary operator
  - Error productions for missing left-hand operands
- Evaluation:
  - Extended addition (strings + numbers)
  - Report division by zero as runtime error
- Statements:
  - Evaluate and print expressions
  - Report uninitialized read as runtime error
- Control flow:
  - Break and continue statements
- Classes:
  - Static methods
  - Static blocks
  - (Static) getters
- Resolving and Binding:
  - Report error on unused local
- Inheritance:
  - `super.init()`:
    - Report error if super.init(...) present but not first statement
    - Automatically call super.init(args) if not first statement
- Misc:
  - Add `.__class__` to get an instance's class
  - Add `.name` to get a class' name
  - Make I/O feasible by adding input functions
    - Implement native `getch` or `getline` functions
    - Add syntax to index into strings, or at least decompose strings
